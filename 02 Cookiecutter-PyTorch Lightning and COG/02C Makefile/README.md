[Makefile: the secret weapon for ML project management](https://valohai.com/blog/makefile-ml-project-management/)

Simple, free, lightweight tool - invented almost 50 years ago 👴🏻- for weaponizing any CLI-based ML project

## Benefits for an ML project:

- Document commands into a single human-readable text file.
- Execute commands with short aliases and TAB completion.
- Avoid re-running commands unnecessarily.

Read about @ in makefile

## In short -
Makes life easy by collating repeated commands which you would run one after another on CLI e.g.

build [docker images]

test [any test cases being tested say test.py ]

run [say, docker run]

clean [say cleaning/ removing, any rm command]
